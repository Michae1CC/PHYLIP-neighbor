# PHYLIP-neighbor
A modified version of PHYLIP's neighbour program.

NOTE:
This is **NOT** my own work, original source code can be found on the PHYLIP website:
https://evolution.genetics.washington.edu/phylip/sourcecode.html

## Usage

```
neighbor [input-matrix-path] [outtree-path] [outfile-path]
```
This program will not prompt you for any inputs, it simply uses the default PHYLIP neighbour prompt arguments.

Run
```
make neighbor
```
to compile the program within a unix environment.
